Cloud is a **client-side** modpack comprised of the **best combination of mods** (e.g. Sodium and Lithium, along with many more) that significantly improves rendering performance, logic performance, memory usage, and more - all without compromising on the game's vanilla looks and features! It is designed to be simple and not include any quality-of-life mods, along with not including redundant performance mods.

# üì• Installation Guide
**Please be sure to read Sodium's [Driver Compatibility](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) section on the wiki before installing Cloud. It contains some important instructions on preventing crashes and other performance issues.**

After installing the modpack, you can easily add your favorite mods so long as they are compatible with the Minecraft version you are playing on.

# ‚úÖ Hardware Compatibility
Cloud supports the use of graphics cards with drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in 2010 or later are compatible. This includes the following hardware:
